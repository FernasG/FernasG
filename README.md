## Hello there!

üëã I'm Fernando Goulart, a technology enthusiast passionate about exploring new areas and solving challenging problems. My journey in programming began with a fascination for web development, but since then, I've expanded my horizons to various other domains.

üíª My primary areas of interest include web development, artificial intelligence and system development. I have experience working with technologies such as TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Python, PHP and frameworks like NestJS, Node.js, Django and React.js. Furthermore, I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies and tools that can enhance my skills and make my projects even more intriguing.

üå± I'm diving deeper into advanced prompt engineering techniques and exploring system development to expand my skill set. Additionally, I'm currently learning the Rust programming language to further broaden my understanding of low-level systems programming and concurrent computing.

üöÄ I'm constantly seeking out challenges that allow me to grow as a developer and contribute to projects that can make a difference. I'm passionate about collaboration and love working as part of a team to achieve common goals.

üîç If you're interested in innovative projects, collaboration, and mutual growth, feel free to get in touch!
